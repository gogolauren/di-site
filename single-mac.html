They have been using a Macbook Pro specifically for around 4 years. Everyone is indicated very frequent use of their macbook pro. We recruited our participants from friend groups.</p>

		          <p>After two rounds of pilot testing, we revised our tasks as below:</p><br/>
                    
                    <dl>
                        <dt>1. You notice that your display is too dark to see properly and you want to adjust the brightness. </dt><br/>
                        <dt>2. You just finished editing an assignment in the Pages application and now you want to switch to the Safari application to submit the assignment online.</dt><br/>
                        <dt>3. You are having a bad day and decide to watch a funny video. Go to YouTube and search for ‚Äúblueberry blueberry.‚Äù Select the first video, and fast forward to the one minute spot to see your favorite part. </dt><br/>
                        <dt>4. You are hosting a party this on Saturday evening and you want to invite your friends. Go to Gmail and compose a new email saying ‚ÄúParty Saturday night at my place! üòÜüíÉüç∫ Looking forward to seeing you!üòÑüòá‚Äù and send it to mkanika@umd.edu. </dt><br/>
                        <dt>5. You are trying to upload a profile picture to your social media account. Unfortunately the image you are trying to upload is too large and must be cropped. Open the photo.jpg image on your desktop then edit the image so only your face is visible.</dt><br/>
                        <dt>6. You are starting a new research project, which will require you to search for a lot of publications on Safari. You want to keep track of the important readings by bookmarking them but you do not have a shortcut on the touch bar to do so. Please find a way to add this shortcut option to your touch bar.</dt>

                        <h2>Results Analysis</h2>
		            	<p>Two charts below show task completion ratio, average time taken on each task, and completion status on each task. One interesting finding is that everyone fails on task 2, except which task 6 has a second lower completion ratio -- 4/6. In terms of average time, task 6 has the longest time which is 222.5 seconds. On the contrary, task 1  costs users the shortest time, only 11.3 seconds, which is 20 times shorter than task 6. For task 2, 3, 5 and 6, behavior of failed users is shown in the below chart. We only consider use the touch bar to finish the task as a success completion. </p>

				        <div class="full-column">
                      
		            	<p>We also conduct a post-questionnaire to get ideas of users' opinions after using the touch bar. Two Likert scale questions are asked. One is "How would you rate your experience with using the touch bar?". Participants' answers are pretty neutral and balanced. Another question is "How likely are you to upgrade your current laptop to this new MacBook Pro after this experience? (only consider the touch bar function)". We only got one positive answer out of 6 responses. </p>

                        <h2>Insights</h2><br/>
		            	 <dl>
                        <dt>1. Manu hierarchy</dt>
                             <dd>Users always get confused about which menu and how deep they are in a menu. If they open one application, but their mouse is not in the same app, they will not be able to see the touch bar changes with the app. </dd><br/>
                        <dt>2. No enough context</dt>
                             <dd>When users tapped some buttons on the touch bar, they saw no response or feedback neither on the mouse nor on the screen. </dd><br/>
                        <dt>3. Difficulty to view the options </dt>
                             <dd>When users tapping the touch bar, their finger will block their view. For example, when users fast forwarded a video on YouTube, they found hard to see the time label in the touch bar. </dd><br/>
                        <dt>4. High give up rate</dt>
                             <dd>Although we printed these words on the top of tasks for users "Each of the following tasks can be completed by using the touch bar. When testing please try and utilize the touch bar as often as possible. If you feel that you cannot continue using the touch bar to complete the task please do not hesitate to switch and use the touchpad.", we found users often did not consider using touch bar as their first choice. Using task 2 as an example, they used touchpad or keyboard shortcut without even a attempt on the touch bar.</dd><br/>
                        <dt>5. Task confusion</dt>
                             <dd>We revised our tasks for two times and we conducted two rounds of pilot tests. We tried to be either leading or non-leading in tasks description once, and we found non-leading is better for carrying out the test. After these revision, some users still got confused about what the task wanted them to do. For instance, in task 6 two users ended with adding a bookmark of a web page, which disobeyed the intention of the task. </dd><br/>

		            	 <dl>
                        <dt>1. Make buttons on the touchbar functional (ex - fast forward, pause, and play buttons).</dt><br/>
                        <dt>2. Add shortcuts for the touchbar (similar to keyboard shortcuts).</dt><br/>
                        <dt>3. Make font size of touchbar larger so it is easier to read. </dt><br/>
                        <dt>4. Make buttons for common tasks more noticeable (ex - crop button when editing photos). </dt><br/>
                        <dt>5. Add physical or audible feedback when editing the touchbar.</dt><br/>
                        <dt>6. Add labels to sub-menus so that users know what menu they are in.</dt>
