                        <p> The participants we used in this study ranged in age from 22 ‚Äì 32 years old. Our sample size was completely made up of Graduate and PHD students who owned a Macbook Pro. When asked how many years they have been using Apple products (including phones, tablets, televisions, and watches), the average answers for the participants was around 10 years. Then when asked how many years they have been using a Macbook specifically, the answer averaged out to about 4 years. Interestingly enough when participants were asked how often they used their Apple products every participant indicated ‚ÄúVery Frequently‚Äù. Most of the participants use their Macbook for the following applications: mail, internet browsing, Office software suite, Adobe software suite, iMessage, and sometimes photo editing. Most of these participants preferred using traditional keyboard shortcuts to using a mouse and/or trackpad. Also, the majority of the participants trended toward using touch screen devices rather than non-touchscreen devices.</p>

                  <h2>Final Tasks</h2>
		          <p>After two rounds of pilot testing, we revised our tasks as below:</p><br/>
                    
                    <dl>
                        <dt>1. You notice that your display is too dark to see properly and you want to adjust the brightness. </dt><br/>
                        <dt>2. You just finished editing an assignment in the Pages application and now you want to switch to the Safari application to submit the assignment online.</dt><br/>
                        <dt>3. You are having a bad day and decide to watch a funny video. Go to YouTube and search for ‚Äúblueberry blueberry.‚Äù Select the first video, and fast forward to the one minute spot to see your favorite part. </dt><br/>
                        <dt>4. You are hosting a party this on Saturday evening and you want to invite your friends. Go to Gmail and compose a new email saying ‚ÄúParty Saturday night at my place! üòÜüíÉüç∫ Looking forward to seeing you!üòÑüòá‚Äù and send it to mkanika@umd.edu. </dt><br/>
                        <dt>5. You are trying to upload a profile picture to your social media account. Unfortunately the image you are trying to upload is too large and must be cropped. Open the photo.jpg image on your desktop then edit the image so only your face is visible.</dt><br/>
                        <dt>6. You are starting a new research project, which will require you to search for a lot of publications on Safari. You want to keep track of the important readings by bookmarking them but you do not have a shortcut on the touch bar to do so. Please find a way to add this shortcut option to your touch bar.</dt>
                    </dl>
                    
                </div> <br/><br/><br/><br/>

                        <h2>Results Analysis</h2>
		            	<p>We only considered participants who used the Touch Bar to complete the task as a successful task completion. Tasks 1 and 4 have 100% success rate, but all six participants failed on task 2. In task 3 and 4 only one participant failed, and in task 6 two participants failed. The average time spent on each task can also been seen in Figure 1. The longest average time is 222.5s on task 6, 20 times longer than the average time of task 1. However, average time does not definitely determine the difficulty of the task. For example, task 4 took participants 157.7s because in that task, participants composed an email. </p><br/>
                        <p>Among the participants who failed on task 2, 1 person used Siri to open the Safari; 2 people clicked the touchpad and 2 people used the keyboard shortcut to open the Safari. The original intention of task 2 was that participants open the default touch bar and tap the app switch button. However, no one finished the task by using the touch bar. They all followed their customs or used their muscle memory. The participant who failed task 3 used the keyboard to fast forward the video. The reason for this behavior is that the participant did not close the default touch bar so that he could not see the video process bar which appeared only with videos playing on Safari. Participant who failed task 5 used Photoshop to finish because she could not find the crop button on the touch bar. Two people failed task 6 and ended up bookmarking a webpage rather than adding a bookmarking option onto the touch bar.</p>

		            	<p>After the test, we asked participants to do a post-test questionnaire asking about their experience with the Touch Bar. For one Likert Scale question ‚ÄúHow would you rate your experience with the Touch Bar?‚Äù, the overall response was neutral. For another Likert Scale question ‚ÄúHow likely are you to upgrade your current laptop to this new MacBook Pro after this experience?‚Äù, although we asked participants to only consider the Touch Bar functionality rather than other factors like the price, our participants‚Äô answers revealed their lack of willingness to upgrade. Followed by these two questions, we had two open questions. One is ‚ÄúWhat do you like most about the Touch Bar?‚Äù. Participants mentioned some pros of the Touch Bar, including the nice display, typing suggestions, the feeling of using new things, and the Touch Bar customization function. But some participants said nothing special at all. Another question we asked is ‚ÄúWhat do you like least about the Touch Bar?‚Äù Participants‚Äô answers include the limited space, unclear structure of the icons, no feedback on the screen, the Touch Bar easily being overlooked, and the confusion it brings. </p>

                        <h2>Insights</h2><br/>
		            	 <dl>
                        <dt><strong>1. Confusion about Menu Hierarchy</strong></dt>
                             <dd>We observed that the participants were often confused about how deep into the Touch Bar menu they were. For example, when the participant is using Safari, the Touch Bar has shortcut for Safari and when the participant starts to compose an email while in Safari, the Touch Bar changes to show autosuggestions, emoticons and other shortcuts for typing. In such situations, we observed how the participant were confused as to why did the shortcuts change and how would they go back to accessing the Safari shortcuts.</dd><br/>
                        <dt><strong>2. No enough context</strong></dt>
                             <dd>We observed how they was not enough context associated with some of the shortcuts in the Touch Bar, which led to confusion for the participants. For example, while working on Safari, there is a search shortcut on the Touch Bar to which acts as an overall Safari search bar. However, one of the participant, while trying to search a video on YouTube confused that search shortcut to be the search bar for YouTube. Later, when the participant realized, she expressed anger. Also, there are a few shortcuts on the Touch Bar which are deactivated and require some action to get activated. Lack of context makes it difficult for the participant to figure out what those deactivated icons do and how to activate them.</dd><br/>
                        <dt><strong>3. Difficulty to view options</strong> </dt>
                             <dd>Another major issue that stood out with multiple participants during multiple tasks was that while trying to use the Touch Bar the participant‚Äôs hand cover a major portion of the Touch Bar, making it difficult to view different information and options available on the Touch Bar. For example, while fast forwarding the video, participant‚Äôs finger covered the time to which the video was being fast forwarded, defeating the purpose of using the fast-forward shortcut on the Touch Bar. </dd><br/>
                             <dt><strong>4. High give up rate</strong></dt>
                             <dd>As seen in the results, some participants just did half the task and gave up thinking that the task is done, whereas for a few tasks the participants quickly moved to using other options instead of the Touch Bar - like the touchpad, keyboard shortcuts and Siri.</dd><br/>
                             <dt><strong>5. Task confusion</strong></dt>
                             <dd>We revised our tasks for two times and we conducted two rounds of pilot tests. We tried to be either leading or non-leading in tasks description once, and we found non-leading is better for carrying out the test. After these revision, some users still got confused about what the task wanted them to do. For instance, in task 6 two users ended with adding a bookmark of a web page, which disobeyed the intention of the task. </dd><br/>

                        <h2>Recommendations for the touch bar</h2><br/>
		            	 <dl>
                        <dt><strong>1. Make buttons on the Touch Bar functional</strong></dt>
                             <dd>Based on our results, we have summarized recommendations on how Apple can improve its Touch Bar‚Äôs usability. The first recommendation is to make the buttons on the Touch Bar functional. Not all buttons on the Touch Bar are functional, as discovered during testing. One of our participants tried to use the fast forward, pause, and play buttons for a task, but noticed that these buttons only changed colors and did not work. Having these buttons on the Touch Bar gives users the idea of functionality, but it was a source of frustration because the participant ended up using the slider to complete the task.</dd><br/>
                        <dt><strong>2. Add shortcuts for the Touch Bar</strong></dt>
                             <dd>The second recommendation is to add shortcuts for the Touch Bar that are similar to keyboard shortcuts. During our testing, keyboard shortcuts were used to complete the tasks. Users familiar with Macbook Pros would know these shortcuts, and adding shortcuts to the Touch Bar can make using it quicker and easier. </dd><br/>
                        <dt><strong>3. Increase font size of the Touch Bar</strong> </dt>
                             <dd>The third recommendation is to make the font size of Touch Bar larger so it is easier to read. One participant noted that the size of the timestamp on the slider was too small to read. Increasing the font size will allow users to read without having to get up close to the Touch Bar. </dd><br/>
                        <dt><strong>4. Make buttons for common tasks more noticeable</strong> </dt>
                             <dd>The fourth recommendation is to make buttons for common tasks more noticeable. When performing the image task, one participant could not find the crop button. The buttons for common tasks should be in a prominent location (for example, in the center) where the users can easily see.</dd><br/>
                        <dt><strong>5. Add physical or audible feedback when editing the Touch Bar</strong></dt>
                             <dd>The fifth recommendation is to add feedback when editing the Touch Bar. Feedback allows users to know that the actions they attempted to do were successful. In the adding shortcuts task, one participant was not sure whether the task was completed or not because there was no feedback after adding a shortcut to the Touch Bar. To deal with this issue, the Touch Bar can show text saying ‚ÄúShortcut added‚Äù as feedback so that users can know that the shortcuts were added.</dd><br/>
                        <dt><strong>6. Add labels to sub-menus</strong></dt>
                             <dd>The sixth recommendation is to add labels to sub-menus so that users know what menu they are in. When users change applications, the menu (and the icons) displayed on the Touch Bar also changes. For example, when the participants did the email task, the Touch Bar icons changed. If users are not familiar with the different icons on the Touch Bar, they may be confused as to what menu they are currently in. A label showing the name of the sub-menu on the left or the right side of the Touch Bar can be added, so users can know the sub-menu they are in.
